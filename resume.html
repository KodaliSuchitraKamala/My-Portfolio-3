                            <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 
                        at NRI Institute of Technology, Agiripalli. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong
                         foundation in AI concepts, machine learning models, and full-stack web development. Throughout
                          my B.Tech program, I have engaged in practical learning through internships and projects, where
                           I applied theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.</p>

                    <p> I completed my Intermediate education in the MPC (Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry) stream at
                         NRI Junior College in 2022, securing a score of 76.1%. During this period, I developed a strong
                          understanding of core mathematical and scientific concepts, which laid the groundwork for my 
                          further studies in technology and engineering. This academic phase helped me build analytical
                           thinking, logical reasoning, and problem-solving skills that continue to support my learning 
                           in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.</p>

                    <p>I completed my Secondary School Certificate (SSC) from Sri Chaitanya High School in 2020,
                         achieving an impressive score of 93.17%. This phase of my education helped me build a
                          strong academic foundation and develop essential skills such as discipline, time management,
                           and a passion for learning. My excellent performance during SSC reflects my dedication and
                            readiness to take on future academic challenges with confidence and determination.</p>
